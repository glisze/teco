# teco
A clone of a port of the Text Editor and COrrector program

https://github.com/glisze/teco/releases/tag/staging%2Fv0.0.73-6474

This branch develops the initialisation of this. The first step is to make
TECO use the linux line-ending convention, ie. using <tt>\n</tt>, and and not
<tt>^M^J</tt>.
