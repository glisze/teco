Here it is tecoc.
This is from the ibiblio archive, tecoc-146.

Now, here, this builds the surroundings. More TECOing is looked forward to.
This also goes towards deployment methods for different systems.


Today, 2018.09.05, we have two new options to configure this.
configure --with-tecomoduledir to say where the given TECO source files go
configure --with-tecoobjectdir to say "there go the squashed" TECO
programs.

Issue, with this: directories are swapped...


Sunday, 2018.09.16, the next step is to verify the included teco macros.
This work aims to find the appropriate initialisation to be done as part
of the command line parsing. There are several issues reported within the
archive, and their status needs to be asserted.

So, here is the preparatory work to have an installed application. This is
what this debian thing means. Having this will ease further work by having
a known and accessible base for further work.


Saturday, 2020.08.29,  setting up to explore the possibilities of the Hurd
system.
