Here it is tecoc.
This is from the ibiblio archive, tecoc-146.

Now, here, this builds the surroundings. More TECOing is looked forward to.
This also goes towards deployment methods for different systems.


Today, 2018.09.05, we have two new options to configure this.
configure --with-tecomoduledir to say where the given TECO source files go
configure --with-tecoobjectdir to say "there go the squashed" TECO
programs.

Issue, with this: directories are swapped...
