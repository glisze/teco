When TECO32 v40.36 (distributed with VAX/VMS v5.3) is run from batch,  and
a "0,256et" command is executed to turn off line wrapping on the terminal,
TECO dies with "Reserved operand fault".  The following patch fixes the bug.

$ set def sys$common:[syslib]
$ patch tecoshr.exe
rep/i 7150
'tstw l^83e'
'beql 71d6'
exit
'movl #1, r0'
exit
update
exit
$ install replace sys$share:tecoshr.exe

Thanks to Rick Murphy at DEC.
